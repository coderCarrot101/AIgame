WHAT IS IT?

I decided that the Terminal-based game genre is criminally underated, so I thought I would throw my try in. The game is a terminal-based puzzel horror game that takes place onboard a space shuttle in the near future, humanity has sent a crew out to Pluto for scouting, but along the way an explosion tears through the ship, leaving only a single survivor and the main AI, your task is to get the shuttle repaired, a distress beacon sent out, and get the poor human back home. The gameplay will be a series of sudo-programming tasks that the player must complete. The tasks will be designed so that anyone can play, even with no prior coding experiance.
