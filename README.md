# rogueAI
This is my first GitHub repo, this is a game where you are an AI on a ship that might be in a little danger

INSPERATION: DUSKERS, BITBURNER, HACKMUD (these games are very cool, also bitburner is free on steam so go try it out if you want)

WHAT IS IT?

I decided that the Terminal-based game genre is criminally underated, so I thought I would throw my try in. The game is a terminal-based puzzel horror game that takes place onboard a space shuttle in the near future, humanity has sent a crew out to Pluto for scouting, but along the way an explosion tears through the ship, leaving only a single survivor and the main AI, your task is to get the shuttle repaired, a distress beacon sent out, and get the poor human back home. The gameplay will be a series of sudo-programming tasks that the player must complete. The tasks will be designed so that anyone can play, even with no prior coding experience.

STATE OF GAME 10/3/2022: so far I have a rough idea on how I want this to work, I have a basic story mapped out (no major spoilers), have a basic 3D scene set up for testing purposes, and a terminal that feels pretty juicy. currently I am testing out a player-programming terminal for the coding-based puzzels

STATE OF GAME 10/21/2022: I made a ton of quality of life improvements, and I am working on setting up the player-programming terminal still. I don't really know how I want the programming to work yet, but I'm thinking about it. NOW THE BIG, THE GREAT, THE WONDERFUL CHANGE! I added an exe file, so now you should be able to test it out for me and give lots of feed back please!

STATE OF GAME 10/29/2022: I think I have how I am gonna have the player "program" down, it will be basically super minimal syntax sudo-code and there will really only be one answer. Which isn't realistic but this is just meant to be a horror puzzel game, not a pragamming sim. I have a basic quest set up that you should be able to do if you follow the instructions but I am gonna add a tutorial in the future. Next update I hope to add some static effects and maybe the start of SFX but we shall see.

STATE OF GAME 11/12/2022: Bug fixes here and there, but the big thing is I added some cool background shaders. Looks very techy.
